# occ - OpenShift Console wrapper for oc command

`occ` is a transparent wrapper around the `oc` command that enhances your OpenShift CLI experience by showing relevant console URLs on stderr while executing your commands.

## Features

- Acts as a transparent wrapper around `oc` - all commands work exactly the same
- Shows relevant OpenShift console URLs for your commands
- Provides direct links to documentation for `oc explain` commands
- Supports autocomplete just like the original `oc` command
- Zero configuration required - works with your existing OpenShift setup

## Installation

1. Download the `occ` script to a directory in your PATH:
```bash
curl -o /usr/local/bin/occ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wingsuitist/occ/main/occ
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/occ
```

2. Or clone this repository and copy the script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wingsuitist/occ.git
cd occ
cp occ /usr/local/bin/occ
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/occ
```

## Enable Autocomplete

To enable autocomplete for `occ`, add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
complete -F __start_oc occ
```

Then reload your shell configuration:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

Use `occ` exactly like you would use `oc`:

```bash
# List pods and see console URL
occ get pods

# Describe a deployment with direct console link to my-app
occ describe deployment my-app

# Get help with documentation links
occ explain pod.spec.containers

# Any oc command works
occ logs my-pod
occ apply -f deployment.yaml
```

## Examples

When you run commands, you'll see console URLs on stderr (shown with üåê):

```bash
$ occ get pods
üåê https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster.example.com/k8s/ns/my-namespace/core~v1~Pod
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-app-7d4b8c8f9-xyz12   1/1     Running   0          5m
```

```bash
$ occ explain pod.spec
üåê https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html-single/workloads_apis/index#pod-v1-1
# ... explanation output
```
